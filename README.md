# Adblock Plus

Welcome to the repository for the Adblock Plus extension!

The main project is hosted on [GitLab][abp-ui] and, in addition to the user
interface and the web extension code, the Adblock Plus extension also includes
the Adblock Plus [core functionality][abp-core].

## About Adblock Plus

Adblock Plus is a free extension that allows users to customize their web
experience. Users can block annoying ads, disable tracking and lots more. Itâ€™s
available for all major desktop browsers and for mobile devices. 

Adblock Plus is an open source project licensed under [GPLv3][gpl3] and subject
to its [Terms of Use][eyeo-terms]. [eyeo GmbH][eyeo] is the parent company of
Adblock Plus.

## Prerequisites

To contribute to this project, you'll need:

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm

**Important**: `Node` should come installed with `npm`. If it doesn't, you can
download `npm` [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

**Tip**: If you're installing `node` in ArchLinux, please remember to install
`npm`, too.

If you want to build the Adblock Plus extension, please refer to the
[Adblock Plus web extension README][abp-webext-readme] for additional
requirements.

After cloning this repository, open its folder and run `npm install`.

## UI elements

Specifications for Adblock Plus elements can be found in [eyeo's spec
repository][abp-spec].

### UI pages

These are pages that users primarily interact with because they are exposed to
them via the browser's UI.

- Bubble UI (popup)
- Developer tools panel (devtools-panel)
- Options
  - Desktop (desktop-options)
  - Mobile (Firefox) (mobile-options)

### Dialogs

These are pages that are dedicated to a specific feature and can be accessed via
UI pages.

- Filter composer (composer)
- Issue reporter (issue-reporter)

### Landing pages

These are pages that cannot be accessed via UI pages. They are either directly
or indirectly opened by the extension under certain conditions.

- Day 1 (day1)
- First run (first-run)
- Problem (problem)
- Updates (updates)

### Helper pages

These are pages that are part of another page. They are not meant to be shown on
their own.

- Bubble UI dummy (popup-dummy)
- Proxy (proxy)

### Additional extension functionality

These are parts of the extension logic which are running alongside the other
extension code in the extension's background process.

- Notifications
- Preferences

## Testing

If you don't want to build the entire extension, you can open UI pages in a test
environment using a local web server. This can be done by running npm start,
which allows you to access the HTML pages under the URL shown in the terminal,
e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Various aspects of the pages can be tested by setting parameters in the URL (see
[list of URL parameters](docs/test-env.md#url-parameters)).

**Note**: You need to [create the bundles](#bundling) for the UI page(s) that
you want to test.

### Nightlies

Nightly builds for feature and release [branches][wiki-branches] can be found
[on this page][abp-ui-nightlies].

**Note**: Nightly builds with snippets are encrypted using GPG.

### Unit testing

The `./test/unit` folder contains various unit tests files. Those can be run
together with other tests via `npm test` or separately via `npm $ test.unit`.

## Integration testing

The `./test/integration` folder contains various integration tests files. Those
can be run together with other tests via `npm test` or separately via
`npm $ test.integration`.

### Smoke testing

The `/test/smoke` folder contains essential files to test custom elements in
isolation. As it's done for `io-element`, you need to add at least an
`io-element.js` test file and its `io-element.html` related page.

You can run `npm run $ test:io-element.js` to create the HTML page inside the
`/smoke` folder.

### End-to-end testing

The `./test/end-to-end/tests` folder contains various end-to-end tests. Run 
`npm run test:end-to-end -- -p EXTENSION_PATH` in order to execute tests in the
latest stable Chrome browser, where `EXTENSION_PATH` is path to the extension
root folder. The `./test/end-to-end/config.js` file contains paths and
descriptions of each executable test.

### Linting

You can lint all files via `npm run lint` or lint only specific file types:
- JavaScript: `npm run $ lint.js`
- SASS: `npm run $ lint.css`
- Translation files: `npm run $ lint.locale`

**Note**: Both `eslint` and `stylelint` can help fix issues via `--fix` flag.
You can try the example below via [npx][npx] which should be automatically
included when you install `npm`.

`npx stylelint --fix skin/real-file-name.css`

## Building

### Bundling the UI

Various files need to be generated before using the UI. When building the UI
for inclusion in the extension, this is achieved using `npm run dist`.

For usage [in the test environment](#testing), you can run `npm run bundle` to
generate the various bundles for all [UI elements](#ui-elements) or
`npm run $ bundle.<page ID>` to create only those that are necessary for a
specific UI page.  Additionally, you need to run `npm run $ bundle.mocks` in
order to create the bundle for the mocks that are being used in the test
environment.

Beyond that, this repository contains [various utilities][wiki-utils] that we
rely on across our development process.

### Building the extension

In order to build the extension, you need to use the
`npm run submodules:update` npm script before you can navigate to the
adblockpluschrome/ directory to follow the instructions for
[building Adblock Plus][abp-webext-readme-build]. This build won't include
the snippets library.

In order to create a build which includes the snippets library, you should use
the `npm run submodules:update-with-snippets` npm script instead. This will
work only if you have access to the [abp-snippets repository][abp-snippets].
